# Living Heirloom — Architecture

Living Heirloom is local-first. Letters live in the writer's browser; exactly two
opt-in features touch the server: **delivery** (a sealed letter emailed on its unlock
date) and **voice** (letters read aloud). There are no user accounts anywhere.

```
React SPA (Vite, src/ → dist/) ──/api──▶ Express (server/)
                                          ├─ generate.ts   → any OpenAI-compatible model
                                          ├─ capsules.ts   → SQLite (WAL) + AES-256-GCM at rest
                                          ├─ delivery/     → node-cron + nodemailer (.eml outbox in dev)
                                          └─ voice/        → kokoro-js | Chatterbox sidecar | ElevenLabs
server/data/                              ← database, outbox, audio cache (gitignored)
```

In development the Vite dev server proxies `/api` to :3001. In production
(`npm run start`, `NODE_ENV=production`) the one Node process serves `dist/`
statically with an SPA fallback and the API together.

## API contract v1

```
GET  /api/health                          → 200 {ok:true}
POST /api/generate                        → {versions: string[]} — drafts from interview answers

POST /api/capsules
  body {title, recipientName?, recipientEmail?, content, tone, unlockAt?, deliver:boolean}
  → 201 {id, ownerToken, viewToken}       (raw tokens returned exactly once)
GET    /api/capsules/:id                  header X-Owner-Token → 200 {capsule} | 401 | 404
DELETE /api/capsules/:id                  header X-Owner-Token → 204 | 401 | 404
GET  /api/letters/:id?k=<viewToken>       → 200 {title, content, writtenAt}
                                          → 403 {opensAt} before unlockAt | 404

GET  /api/voice/voices                    → 200 {provider, voices:[{id,label,lang}]}
                                          → 200 {provider:"none", voices:[]} if unconfigured
POST /api/voice/synthesize                body {text<=6000, voiceId?}
                                          → 200 audio stream (audio/wav or audio/mpeg)
                                          → 503 {error} if no provider available
```

All capsule/letter endpoints answer `503 {error}` when `LH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is unset —
delivery is a feature you switch on, not a requirement.

## Security model

- **No accounts.** A capsule returns two one-time tokens at creation: an owner token
  (manage/cancel) and a view token (the recipient's private link). Both are 32 random
  bytes, base64url, stored **hashed (sha256)**; the view token is additionally stored
  encrypted at rest so the mailer can build the delivery link.
- **Encryption at rest.** Letter content and recipient fields are AES-256-GCM
  encrypted per field (`base64(iv).base64(tag).base64(ciphertext)`), key from
  `LH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32-byte base64). Titles are plaintext by design (they appear
  in email subjects and owner listings).
- Rate limiting on capsule creation; zod validation on every body; unknown view
  tokens return 404 (not 401) so capsule existence is never revealed.

## Delivery

A node-cron tick every minute (plus a catch-up tick at startup) selects due capsules
(`deliver=1`, not yet delivered, `unlock_at <= now`, fewer than 5 attempts) and sends
via SMTP when `SMTP_HOST` is configured. Without SMTP, delivery writes `.eml` files
to `server/data/outbox/` — the documented development fallback. Failures record
`delivery_error` and retry on later ticks, up to 5 attempts.

## Voice

A single `TTSProvider` interface (`server/voice/provider.ts`) with three adapters;
selection order: explicit `TTS_PROVIDER` env → kokoro if its runtime loads → none.
Synthesized audio is cached by content hash in `server/data/audio/`. Kokoro's model
loading and inference run in a dedicated worker thread
(`kokoro.worker.mjs`) — CPU synthesis of a full letter can take minutes, and
running it on the main thread would stall every other request, including the
delivery scheduler's tick, for that whole time. Engine details, setup, and
licensing: [voice.md](voice.md).

## Frontend layers

- `src/lib/capsules.ts` — the local letter store (localStorage), extended with
  optional `serverId`/`ownerToken`/`deliverTo` when a letter opted into delivery.
- `src/lib/api.ts` — the typed client for the contract above; components never see
  raw fetch errors.
- Design system: paper/ink/sealing-wax tokens in `src/index.css`; Fraunces
  (display), Newsreader (letter voice), Inter (interface), self-hosted via
  @fontsource latin subsets. Reduced-motion is honored globally.

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` — every variable is documented there with safe defaults.
